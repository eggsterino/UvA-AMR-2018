## Assignment 1

In this assignment, we will learn how to control the EV3 robot using MATLAB. We have two control tasks, open-loop control and closed-loop control.


#### Getting Started
1. Download the scene file from [here](../blob/master/Assignment_1/assignment_1_scene_1.ttt)
2. Open V-Rep simulator import the scene into the simulator. You can do so using the program menu `File` then click on  the menu item `Open Scene ...`. Another way to open the scene is to drag-drop it to the window of the V-Rep simulator.
3. The next step is to start your MATLAB to write the script and control the EV3 robot in the scene you just loaded. Open 

#### What is Required?

1. Open-loop Control

You are required to write MATLAB script to control and move the EV3 through the maze without using any feedback from the sensor. Trial and error is enough for this part.


2. Closed-loop Control

For this part, you're required to read the data of one of the EV3 sensors and use it to navigate through the maze. May be Sonar is enough?


Handing-In

All what is required is to write your code for the 2 tasks in two separate MATLAB script files. Then, hand-in them using Blackboard.
